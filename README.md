Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is  a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software. It
is important because it improves healthcare systems, it enables remote education and enhances online security

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Structured Programming - Introduced a more organized code with concepts like functions and loops
Object-Orientated-Programming - Introduced the concept of objects which enabled code reusability and flexibility
Agile Methodologies - Emphasized iterative development and close collaborations between developers and
                      stakeholders

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Idea Generation - Planning and coming up with an idea
Requirement Analysis - Identifying and taking note of the  software requirements
Product Design - Designers create the system architecture and User Interface based on the requirements
Product Development - Developers build the software according to the design and requirements
Integration and Testing - The software is tested to see if it has no bugs and meets the requirements 
Deployment - The software is delivered to users
Maintenance - Software is kept running and up to date and and updated based on user feedback


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall -  is sequential and each step/phase is completed before moving on to the next. It is not flexible and difficult to implement changes after development has started. An example is a large government project with fixed budgets and timelines

Agile Methodology - is iterative and flexible with continuous updates and improvements. Changes can be made at any step/phase. An example may be a video game where gameplay features may evolve.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - Designs, codes and maintains software applications. It's responsibilities include writing, testing and debugging code and collaborating with designers and other developers

Quality Assurance Engineer - Automates testing processes for effeciency. It's responsibilites include identifying bugs to make sure product meets requirements

Project Manager - Ensures that projects are completed in time and within budget. It's responsibilities include creating project blueprints and ensuring that the project stays on track and meets client expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - they help with code editing and auto completion which helps developers write code faster and efficiently
Examples - Visual Studio Code and PyCharm

VCS - they help with tracking code changes by saving different versions of code, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
Examples - Git and Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging -  Searching for and fixing bugs can be time consuming especially with programs that have many lines of code
Solution - Using debugging tools in IDE's and writing unit tests

Meeting Deadlines - Some projects have tight deadlines which is also time consuming and may lead to stress
Solution - Using Task Management tools to organize work and breaking tasks into smaller pieces

Keeping up with the latest technologies - Technology evolves rapidly making it difficult to stay up to date
Solution -  Follorwing tech blogs and forums and experimenting with the new technologies in personal projects

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - Testing individual components and ensures that each small piece of the software works correctly on its own.
               It's important as it detects bugs early, reducing future errors.
Integration testing - Testing how different unit of the software interact with each other. It's important as it ensures that 
                      components work together as expected.
System testing - Testing the entire software application as a whole to ensure that it meets all requirements. It's important 
                 as it confirms that the full system behaves as expected.

Acceptance testing - Testing conducted to determine if the software meets business requirements.
                     It's important as it ensures that the software fulfills customer expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. It's important as it enhances response quality and reduces misinterpratation.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt - Tell me about Africa
Improved Prompt - Tell me about Africa, its countries, and the varieties in cultures.

The first prompt is too broad and lacks specificity. The improved prompt is more effective as it provides more clarity and focuses on Africa's countries and cultural diversity.
